    title: "James and Other Apes (#JAPES)",
    description:
      "As the greenlist for the presale of the #JAPES project opens, James Mollison talks about his journey to realizing this extraordinary collection, which combines the NFT community’s obsession with apes with his portraits of great apes shot over four years and across four continents. Greenlist registration is now open at art3.io/japes ahead of the exclusive drop on OpenSea later this month.",

After capturing a chance shot of a gorilla on the very last frame of my roll of film, an incredible journey began. This shot ignited my fascination with capturing these magnificent animals. It also reminded me how fast and how chaotic taking pictures really is. The gorilla was looking right through the lens and right at me, almost into me, and what I saw staring back was very familiarly human.</p><p>This powerful moment acted as a catalyst to ‘James &amp; Other Apes’. A collection of just over 50 passport-style photographs capturing the unique identity of apes from sanctuaries spanning four continents. Since accompanying a solo exhibition at the Natural History Museum in 2004, this collection has been globally observed, both in print and digitally. Now, as my <a href="https://art3.io/drops/japes/">genesis blockchain collection</a>, these intriguing portraits will soon be available as exclusive NFT editions of one. NFTs are a new exciting journey for me as an artist. But this kind of escapade isn’t foreign to me.</p><p>Whilst creating the collection I was continuously challenged with feelings of both fear and excitement. I had to quickly learn how to act around the apes in a way that made it clear I wasn’t a threat. I learnt to sit in a submissive manner with my shoulders quite hunched down, and kind of nodding to them, trying to make it clear I was their friend rather than their foe. I’d often have to think on my feet and trial new techniques to gain the trust of these beautifully dominant animals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62df25f03ad4d8fbbf70bb37/635476ebf9667434a8427a85_A-058.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the first monkeys I photographed was a large chimpanzee from Cameroon called Gino. During my time with Gino, I quickly realised the challenging nature of photographing apes. He had feisty energy but after composing my anxiety, I eventually established that I could use a peanut taped to the end of my lens to encourage the chimp to look into the camera. He loved this game as he continued to snatch peanuts from the top of my lens at the speed of lightning! During my time with Gino I had the opportunity to analyze his face and this caused me to deeply reflect on how similar he was to me.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62df25f03ad4d8fbbf70bb37/635476ffdf99c7d864496a9c_Frame-262.png" alt=""></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We think of apes as different species. But, like us, they each have their own individual personalities and characteristics. Genetically, they are incredibly close to us. We are very different from most animals, but monkeys inspire questions about ourselves, because they are so alike us! Working with these apes took me straight back to my childhood. There’s a naughtiness to young apes that reminds me of being a cheeky young boy. They embody the grey area between man and animal and they easily connect with our inner child. To me, having an ape as a way to express who you are, as an avatar, makes perfect sense.</p><p>Except for two, all of the apes I photographed are orphans. For quite a few, their parents had been killed for bushmeat. Sadly, there’s a masculinity belief amongst some groups that eating gorilla meat can make you virile. I hope this collection, at the very least, helps us to truly consider the relationship between man and animal.</p><p>10% of the net proceeds we raise will be donated to the sanctuaries in Africa that rescued these incredible animals and invited me in with my camera.<br>For more information about me and the project, and to register for the #JAPES greenlist, please visit <a href="https://art3.io/drops/japes/">art3.io/japes</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

    title: "Launching Seaport & Saving the Community Millions in Fees",
    description:
      "Today, OpenSea is migrating to Seaport, a new web3 marketplace protocol designed for safely and efficiently buying and selling NFTs. Seaport is a game changer – it’s open source, inherently decentralized, and a modern foundation that will help us (and any teams using it) build and release new features more quickly.",
    content:
      '<p>We’re excited to be one of the first marketplaces using it; and at launch, you’ll start to notice a few major improvements on OpenSea:</p><p>Significantly lower gas costs</p><p>The ability to make offers on entire collections or on multiple items with specific attributes (traits)</p><p>New OpenSea users will no longer have to pay an account initialization fee (proxy deployment)</p><p>Signatures to confirm actions using your wallet will be much easier to read and understand. For more information on ‘typed signature requests,’ please see our <a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/4449355421075-What-does-a-typed-signature-request-look-like-">help center article</a>.</p><h2><strong>Cheaper Transactions</strong></h2><p>You’ll<strong> save an estimated 35% in gas fees for transactions using Seaport</strong>. Based on last year’s data, that would amount to more than $460m in total savings (138k in ETH)!* Plus, new users won’t have to pay a one-time setup fee (proxy deployment) to use OpenSea. By removing the setup fee alone, the OpenSea community could save almost $120m each year (35k in ETH).</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62df25f03ad4d8fbbf70bb37/63532c84e1eb228255cae6e7_04Seaport-Avg-1-2048x847.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>Seaport is designed to be more gas efficient and flexible compared to other web3 marketplaces. The protocol developers worked in <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/assembly.html">Assembly</a> to optimize transaction efficiency. Here is a table summarizing some of the gas savings for different types of transactions.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62df25f03ad4d8fbbf70bb37/63532cb4981d975a18fc1c0b_02Seaport-Gas-1508x2048.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>To see lower gas fees when selling or transferring NFTs, you’ll need to approve collections (token addresses) — <i>but this is a one-time cost per collection, and no existing listings will be affected by the migration.</i></p><h2><strong>Collection Offers (by Attribute)</strong></h2><p>Seaport also allows us to quickly build new features that were previously impossible.</p><p>Starting today, you can make Collection Offers, which are offers on all items in a collection. You can also make Attribute Offers, offers on a group of items with specific attributes. To start, Attribute Offers will only be available for the top 100 collections (by 30-day volume on OpenSea).</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62df25f03ad4d8fbbf70bb37/63532c2beb58adea63282271_giphy.gif" alt="Animated GIF"></figure><h2><strong>Coming soon</strong></h2><p>Thanks to Seaport, we’ll be able to more quickly launch new features – like bulk listings – that will give you the ability to purchase many NFTs in a single transaction. Real-time creator fees will be available for multiple recipients. Creators will also be able to define their fees on-chain on a per-item basis with multiple payout addresses.</p><p>We’re always looking for new ideas to improve the OpenSea experience, so join the community on Discord or track us on Twitter and Instagram if you want to share your thoughts. And if you’re interested in building new and innovative features to empower the future of NFTs, <a href="https://opensea.io/careers">we’re hiring across the board</a>.</p><p>We’re excited about the journey ahead, and we hope you’ll join us. It’s time to build.</p><p><i>*Estimate calculated by adding up 35% savings on successful purchase transaction gas fees and total gas fees paid for proxy deployment transactions on OpenSea from May 2021-May 2022.</i></p>',

    title: "How to Find an NFT You Love !!!",
    description:
      "With so many projects out there, we know it can seem hard to find an NFT you love. Here are a few things you may want to keep in mind to simplify the process.",
    content:
      "<ol><li><strong>Consider the purpose of purchasing.</strong> Are you buying an NFT you’ll use for a profile photo (PFP)? Alternatively, is it purely for art? Is it something you’d display at home? Maybe you’re looking for virtual land? How long do you plan to own the NFT? Asking these questions will help you narrow down the search as you browse.</li><li><strong>Research the project. </strong>Start with the official project website. This is a great starting point to understand motivations and goals of the founder(s). Many projects these days have a roadmap with lots of milestones. Does it seem realistic, or is it overly ambitious? Make sure to also check the project’s social media.</li><li><strong>The founders.</strong> Most times, founders drive the vision, future and success of a project. It’s time to introduce two terms: doxxed and undoxxed. Doxxed founders have made their identity publicly known so you are able to research their background/history of success. Undoxxed founders have not revealed their identity and often go by an alias.</li><li><strong>Join their Discord. </strong>You might buy an NFT just for the art, but you shouldn’t overlook the community. Checking out the project’s Discord is usually the best way to get a sense of the community and meet your fellow collectors. Join the discord and ask questions of the community and moderators. Are they helpful and welcoming?</li><li><strong>Research the artist. </strong>Artistry takes many forms. Some artists are brilliant and just starting out. Others are accomplished and have a history of other successful projects. At the end of the day, does the art make you feel a certain way? Do you want to support the artist?</li><li><strong>Rarity features. </strong>NFT’s are unique and each one has unique rarity. Usually, NFT’s that are more rare are more sought after. You can see the traits, which drive rarity, in the left hand bar when on a project page.</li><li><strong>Project stats (eg. floor price, volume, owners).</strong> NFT users often focus on floor price. Yes – some projects might “moon” overnight, but you shouldn’t overlook other stats like volume and the number of owners. A collection with a high floor price and no volume is meaningless.<br>If this is a short term purchase, factoring in the volume of how many users are buying and selling at any given time will be important if you ever decide to sell. Likewise, for profile picture projects (PFPs), projects having fewer owners may have difficulty gaining long-term traction and building community.</li></ol><p>Ultimately, there are many points to think about when purchasing a NFT. At the end of the day, most people love NFT’s for the art and joy they provide. Once you have your NFT, make sure to share it with your fellow collectors!</p>",
